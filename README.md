# Api-setup-project-with-Dingo
A project for REST API use with Dingo incorporated in it. It is only the setup for it. 

Thsi was the second project I started to learn API, but wanted to see how Dingo was incorporated. I followed a tutorial:

I had plans to follow through this approach to learn API, but afer the setup I felt I understood enough 
to work on the test I was given to accomplish. I am uploading it here in case I need to continue it in the future.
